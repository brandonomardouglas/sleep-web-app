## How To Use
- The landing page has settings
- Input the time in minutes you're attempting to sleep for (between 10 minutes and 40 minutes, recommended 20 minutes) + the time in minutes of getting up again before the original sleep timer starts again (between 5 and 20 minutes)
- Toggle button for white noise with dedicated volume knob
- Large font for 'sleep attempts':
  - This is the number of times you have remained in bed before the 'get up' timer starts
- Theres a tick noise for every second, plus a text to speach announcer every minute that goes (T minus, 19 minutes for example)
- After 'break', prompt the user to restart the time again
- if there's no prompt, pause all timers and log count?
